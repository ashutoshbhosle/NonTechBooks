# NonTechBooks
In order to improve my project execution/completion skills, I decided to read and and summarize different programming books which are often cited as quintessential in reading lists. The aim was to compliment my technical preparation of interviews(data-structures and algos) with non-technical knowledge which is often critical in completing projects quickly with clean code. I have written each book and the things I thought were useful for me at that point of time.
